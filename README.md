## How to incorporate SlimeDogCore in your plugin
Add to `pom.xml` sections
```
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>jitpack.io</id> <!-- For automated building of SlimeDogCore-->
            <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
    
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.github.SlimeDog</groupId>
            <artifactId>SlimeDogCore</artifactId>
            <version>0.1.9-SNAPSHOT</version>
            <scope>compile</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
```
The dependency needs to be shaded into the plugin (included in its jar).
So the following is also needed under build -> plugins
```
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>3.3.1</version>
      <configuration>
        <relocations>
            <relocation>
                <pattern>dev.ratas.slimedogcore</pattern>
                <shadedPattern>${project.groupId}.${project.artifactId}.core</shadedPattern>
            </relocation>
        </relocations>
      </configuration>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <phase>package</phase>
          <goals>
            <goal>shade</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
```
PS: It is strongly advised that the dependency be relocated so as to avoid conflicts with other plugins which may have a different version of SlimeDogCore included. One can notice that this is also done in the above example.
