<h2>üõë End Of Life for SlimeDog resources</h2>

SlimeDog support for Minecraft plugins will reach end-of-life with releases for MC 1.21.0.

What we will do:
- Update SlimeDogCore and SlimeDog resources to support Paper and Spigot 1.20.6 and 1.21.0.
- Archive SlimeDog Github repositories.
- Post this notice
  - on the `Overview` and `Documentation` pages of SlimeDog resources on SpigotMC.
  - in the `README` for SlimeDog repositories on Github.
  - on the `Home` page of SlimeDog wikis on Github. 
- Remove SlimeDog resources from bStats.
- Remove SlimeDog resources from Hangar, so that others may post resources with the same names.
- Remove SlimeDog/AggressiveAnimals from Modrinth (no other SlimeDog resources were posted there).

Support for future Minecraft versions:
- Some SlimeDog resources ‚Äî EntityCount and PluginVersions, for example ‚Äî will likely work well into the future, but there are no guarantees.
- Other SlimeDog resources ‚Äî AggressiveAnimals and pHD, for example ‚Äî will likely not work on future MC versions without updates.
- All SlimeDog resources are open-source, released under GPL3 licenses.
- SlimeDog resources may be forked and updated to support future Minecraft versions, or for any other purpose permitted under GPL3 licensure.
